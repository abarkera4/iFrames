## || What Do? ||
============================

- As of **1.1.0**, the versions have been condensed. **Selecting Full or Limited is now a dropdown selection with Presets**!
- Adds or extends iFrames for various actions with configurable presets for iFrame duration.
- Duration Preset can be changed in-game and will be remembered even when closing the game.
- There are 2 modes, **which are now a dropdown menu like presets**!

### Limited 
- iFrames for ladders, jumping, parries, kicks, and terrain interactions like vaulting over obstacles.

### Full
- iFrames for all Limited cases as well as more states that are considered "Combating." This covers ground executions with a knife and similar states.

To get the iFrames covering the extra cases in the Full version, they are also active during knife swings. Some testers liked this, others felt like it was too much. Pick the one that suits you.

- Within each version, there are several presets for iFrame Duration in seconds:
  1. **Shorter** - 0.1s
  2. **Short** - 0.2s
  3. **Default** - 0.3s
  4. **Long** - 0.4s
  5. **Longer** - 0.5s
